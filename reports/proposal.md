## Cynthesizer: Software Synthesizers in C

Software Systems Spring 2018
Andrew Deaver, Kai Levy, and Patrick Huston


### Project Goals
In this project, we hope to explore audio synthesis in C. As a lower bound on our goal, we plan on creating a software-based implementation of a synthesizer on an Arduino that can (a) produce an audio signal and (b) include at least some basic controls to modify the signal to create new sounds. 

Once we get a basic implementation working, our next goals might be:

1. Working on lowering latency and general optimizations
2. Implementing finer/more interesting controls to modify the audio signal

### Learning Goals

Some of our shared learning goals include:

- Effectively use OOP in C
- Learn a bit about DSP and audio generation
- Use external packages
- Combine our interests in programming and electronic music

### Getting Started

We believe that a good reference for this project will be the Audio Programming Book by Boulanger and Lazzarini. Specifically, a few of the chapters that we envision being most useful for this project are:

- Audio Programming in C
- Spectral Audio Programming Basics: The DFT, the FFT, and Convolution
- Programming the Phase Vocoder
- A Modular Synthesizer Simulation Program
- MIDI Programming with PortMIDI

Another resource that we intend to use to get started is a project from a former iteration of the class. We believe that this will give us a good starting point to build on for the rest of the project.

### First Steps

Our first tasks include:
1. Gain a basic theoretical background of audio programming by reading the 'Basics of Audio Programming' chapter of the Audio Programming in C book. We will all work on this task concurrently. 
2. Get started on implementing the hardware of the [SoftSysSynthesizer](http://thinkdsp.blogspot.com/2014/02/build-softsyssynth.html). We will start by sourcing and gathering materials. We will work on this together - the 'done' criteria will be an implementation of the synthesizer as described in the project documentation. 
3. Get started on implementing the software of the [SoftSysSynthesizer](http://thinkdsp.blogspot.com/2014/02/build-softsyssynth.html). We will all work on this. The 'done' criteria will be a basic implementation that makes sound.
